      <description>Introduction Chosing parameters General Linear Model Reverse Engineering Running Analyses (Welchâ€™s t Test) Analysis (ANOVA) Power Analysis Brute Force Power Analysis   Introduction I am currently planning a replication and extension of an experimental study that had a count-based dependent variable. The aim is to submit it as a registered report before collecting the data and so I need to have an analysis plan and estimated sample size/stopping rule.</description>

      <description>Last night I submitted my first pre-registration to the OSF.io Pre-registration challenge.
The study is a Bayesian meta-analysis of studies using video game avatars to influence health behaviours and attitudes. The process involved the following:
Deconstructing a previous meta-analysis Initially I wanted to learn meta-analytical methods by using previous data rather than beating my own data into submission. This was a difficult process since:
 the supplementary data was a pdf with that weird tendancy to select content in random patterns</description>
