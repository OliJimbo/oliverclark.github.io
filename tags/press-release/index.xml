      <description>Hi - just a quick note on academic posters at conferences.
I have seen that a few posters have received some media attention this week.
In the only one that I&amp;rsquo;ve had a close look at the analysis was very tenuous and the conclusion seemed to rely on the lack of significant effect in a t-test which follows the denial of the antecedent fallacy.
There were other issues, like bar graphs being presented that started from a non-zero integer, and various methodological issues that (I hope) would have been desk rejected or raised by reviewers.</description>
