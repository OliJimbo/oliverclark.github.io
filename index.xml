      <description>Hi - just a quick note on academic posters at conferences.
I have seen that a few posters have received some media attention this week.
In the only one that I&amp;rsquo;ve had a close look at the analysis was very tenuous and the conclusion seemed to rely on the lack of significant effect in a t-test which follows the denial of the antecedent fallacy.
There were other issues, like bar graphs being presented that started from a non-zero integer, and various methodological issues that (I hope) would have been desk rejected or raised by reviewers.</description>

      <description>Todayâ€™s lesson is that writing systematic search terms is hard.
That is a bit of an oversimplification, which is the topic of this blog.
It has actually taken me two days to figure this out.
I have read a number of meta-analysis papers, have reproduced one and am currently embarking on my very own. The methods sections of these papers are usually very zen:
The search terms were set &amp;quot;This phrase&amp;quot; AND (this word OR that) Two hundred Retrieved Naturally I totally bought this and excitedly started my search using the draft search strategy I had produced for my PRISMA statement.</description>

      <description>In true coding fashion, here&amp;rsquo;s the obligatory hello world post. I&amp;rsquo;ve been typing hello world into programming langyages since I was 12 and that&amp;rsquo;s usually as far as I got with coding until about 2 years ago when I started using PsychoPy.
The purpose of this blog is to document my PhD progress to try and encourage me to write. I keep a research notebook but the handwriting is terrible and whenever I read back on it the content is incoherant.</description>

      <description>Last night I submitted my first pre-registration to the OSF.io Pre-registration challenge.
The study is a Bayesian meta-analysis of studies using video game avatars to influence health behaviours and attitudes. The process involved the following:
Deconstructing a previous meta-analysis Initially I wanted to learn meta-analytical methods by using previous data rather than beating my own data into submission. This was a difficult process since:
 the supplementary data was a pdf with that weird tendancy to select content in random patterns</description>

      <description>I am a PhD student at Manchester Metropolitan University trying to apply lessons learned from the reproducability crisis to a project on the Proteus Effect, health and body image.
Background:  I studied a BSc in Psychology at the University of Hull between 2004-2007. My dissertation was on driver distraction and roadside advertising.
 I studied for an MRes in Psychological Research Methods between 2007-2008 for which I investigated Visual Variant Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s Disease.</description>
