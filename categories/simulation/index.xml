      <description>Introduction I am currently planning a replication and extension of an experimental study that had a count-based dependent variable. The aim is to submit it as a registered report before collecting the data and so I need to have an analysis plan and estimated sample size/stopping rule.
One of the ways that this can be achieved is by simulating the data that you expect to see if your hypothesis is correct.</description>
