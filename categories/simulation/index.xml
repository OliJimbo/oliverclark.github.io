      <description>I have been planning yet another study1.
Introduction My current experiment is a follow-up to a previous (qualitative) paper that I have now written up. I am using the same task that I used during the interview study, but am measuring self-report likert scales rather than interpreting narratives. My planned study quickly exploded and became hugely complex, so I thought I would take a step back and start by running a short pilot study to investigate whether the manipulation is effective on a single measure before delving into the structural equation modelling nightmare that it has become.</description>

      <description>Introduction Chosing parameters General Linear Model Reverse Engineering Running Analyses (Welchâ€™s t Test) Analysis (ANOVA) Power Analysis Brute Force Power Analysis   Introduction I am currently planning a replication and extension of an experimental study that had a count-based dependent variable. The aim is to submit it as a registered report before collecting the data and so I need to have an analysis plan and estimated sample size/stopping rule.</description>
